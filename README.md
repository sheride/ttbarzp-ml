A generic beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theory involves the introduction a Z' particle, a neutral heavy U(1) gauge boson. Such a particle could, in particular, explain the B-meson anomalies [1] or the g-2 muon anomaly [2];  however, one must also consider why such a particle hasn't yet been observed at the LHC. We endeavor to explain the experimental anomalies along with our present discovery failures by considering a Z' which couples strongest to the third generation quarks.

We embark on a collider phenomenology program investigating the `p p > t t~ Z'` channel, wherein the Z' may decay to, e.g., `b b~`, `t t~`, `tau tau~`, or `mu mu~`. Likewise, each top may decay hadronically (`t > W b > j j b`) or leptonically (`t > W b > l~ nu b`).

The difficulty that arises in discriminating signal from background (which include, e.g., `p p > t t~ h` and `p p > t t~ t t~`) motivates the use of machine learning methodologies. This github repository documents code developed and employed to study this binary classification problem, focusing on the `Z' > b b~` semihadronic-semileptonic channel.
